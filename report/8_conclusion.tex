\section{Conclusion}
After intensively comparing both the MESI and Dragon cache coherence protocol
using three distinct benchmarks and several varying cache design choices, we can
conclude that even though they work differently, the difference between their
overall performance is negligible. It is far more important for the performance, which other cache design
choices, like the size, associativity or block size, are made. Even though both
protocols have certain scenarios which they handle more efficiently than other
protocols, the overall overhead of cache coherency outweighs these advantages.

Looking at the optimization of the MESI protocol implemented in the advanced
task, we can also conclude that changes which first look like an improvement can
also lead to unwanted side effects. In the case of the \emph{Read-Broadcast}
optimization, this can be seen in less exclusive states, leading to more
required invalidations. This shows that the actual performance impact of every
optimization has to be carefully evaluated using real world programs like our
benchmarks. Otherwise, optimizing without constant performance analysis might
even degrade the cache coherence systems performance.
